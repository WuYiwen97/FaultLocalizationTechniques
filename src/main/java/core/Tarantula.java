 * Calculates suspiciousness and confidence values according to the Tarantula fault localization

 * The usage mode is to create a coverage matrix that specifies which program
 * elements are executed by which test cases. In terms of this implementation, each program element called
 * a statement. coverage matrix is encoded as a two dimensional array where the first dimension is indexed by
 * the test case number and the second dimension is indexed by the statement number.
